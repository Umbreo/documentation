The auto-privisioned instances can be linked to your servers in the clouds. To do so, you need to create a new provider. Read more about providers [here](/core-concepts/providers).

During the creation of your provider you will need to use credentials given by your cloud service to make their APIs accessible by Umbreo.

### Getting Started

1. To start with your first auto provisioned instance go to your **[Instances](https://beta.umbreo.com/instances)** page > **New Instance**. Or you can directly click **deploy** on a blueprint in the **[Blueprints](https://beta.umbreo.com/blueprints)** page. 

2. Now you have to fill the form with the name and description of your instance, select a blueprint that you want to deploy in your instance, and finally choose **Auto-Provisioned** Instance as a type of the instance.

3. Once you do that, you will be asked to choose a provider, or you can create a new one and fill the credentials to proceed.

4. If everything goes well you will be redirected to your new instance's page. There you will need to proceed by running the provision of your instance with the selected blueprint.
