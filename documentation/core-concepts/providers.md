Providers are what can make [Auto-Provisioned Instances](/automating-deployments/auto-provisioned) possible. They represent cloud providers where your servers are running. 

Until now we support the following Cloud Providers :

* Amazong Web Services
* Digital Ocean
* Open Stack
* Google Compute Engine

From the <a href="http://beta.umbreo.com/providers" target="_blank"> Providers page</a>, you will be able to choose one of the available cloud providers, then deploy the desired Blueprint to a particular server that you already have in the cloud or you can create new instances in the cloud by providing your credentials directly from Umbreo.

You can read about the other types of instances in this [article](/core-concepts/instances).
