By default, when using Umbreo CLI, your Umbreo Endpoint is [https://beta.umbreo.com](https://beta.umbreo.com). It means that all of your commands will interact with that Endpoint.

If you consider having [Umbreo CE](/developers/community-edition), you might need to point at your own edition of Umbreo. And because of that we are introducing a new feature in the Umbreo CLI to configure which Endpoint you want to point at.

<br />

### Requirements

Having the Umbreo CLI Gem installed. [learn more](/developers/cli#installation)

<br />

### Configure your Endpoint

Run `umbreo endpoint configure`
Enter URL of your new Endpoint.

If you want to point at your own Endpoint, then you will need to have your Umbreo CE.

### Troubleshooting

Make sure that your Endpoint URL is accessible in network.
