# What is Umbreo?
<br>
Umbreo is a cloud-based platform that gives companies, developers & startups the power to easily and quickly build world-class IT infrastructure. To do so, we go beyond traditional configuration management tools by providing **configuration management as a service**.

We achieve this by combining best-of-breed technologies that give system administrators and developers the ultimate control, insight and automation possibilities necessary to build an agile, scalable and secure IT infrastructure quickly and easily.

Umbreo was specifically created to address the main issues that traditional configuration management tools can present, since they can be error prone, hard to maintain and can quickly become the problem instead of the solution.

Umbreo provides a unique service that gives our users unmatched control and simplicity through a powerful and intuitive cloud platform, which enables them to focus more on what's really important, which is delivering value to their customers.
