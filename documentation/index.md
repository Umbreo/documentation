### **What is Umbreo ?**

Umbreo reduces the configuration time from months to a few minutes and simplifies the process, so companies won't have to depend on highly skilled system admins. 

Umbreo's main offering is Configuration Management as a Service (CMaaS), which means it has all the benefits of a traditional Configuration Management, such as keeping your infrastructure consistent, controlling the IT-infrastructure from a central location, dynamic inventory of the IT-infrastructure etc.

Umbreo is available in a cloud version and an on-premise version. Furthermore our cloud version can handle servers that are on-premise or in the cloud.
